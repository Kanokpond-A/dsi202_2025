Whether you're planting one tree a month or growing a home garden with eco-tools, you're not just giving back‚Äîyou're growing forward.

## What is PLOOKJING?

PLOOKJING allows users to choose tree species and assign real-world planting locations. Once planted, each tree becomes part of the user's digital forest, complete with care updates, growth tracking, and a personal sense of environmental impact. The platform also features a curated eco-shop offering trees, tools, and accessories for those who prefer planting with their own hands at home or in their communities.

**We provide multiple ways for users to take action:**

- Remote tree planting in designated provinces  
- In-home planting with ordered equipment  
- Growth monitoring and alerts  
- Personalized dashboards showing planted trees and order history
